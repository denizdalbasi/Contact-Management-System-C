# Person Directory Application (C)

A simple **console-based Person Directory application written in C**.  
This program allows users to **add, delete, search, list, and permanently store people information** using file operations.

The project is designed to practice **structs, enums, typedefs, functions, and file I/O** in C.

## Features

- Add a new person
- Delete a selected person (even if multiple people share the same name)
- Search people by first name
- List all stored people
- Save data permanently to a file (`people.txt`)
- Load data automatically when the program starts

- **Struct** – To represent a person  
- **Typedef** – To simplify struct usage
